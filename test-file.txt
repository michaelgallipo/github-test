Today was a sad day as Dover lost to Portsmouth in lacrosse.
This will pretty much guarantee that Dover does not finish in the twop of two of NH Div 2.
It was a pretty ugly game filled with turnovers and selfish play.

On the plus side, Sean had a really nice goal on a rebound. His second goal sicne coming back from his knee injury.

Sean had a good sized cheering section as his brother was home from college, Nana was back in NH, and his girl friend was at the game as well (plus of course mom and dad).
